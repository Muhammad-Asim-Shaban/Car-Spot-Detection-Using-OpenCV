# üÖøÔ∏è Smart Parking Space Detector

---

## ‚ú® Description
This project implements a **Smart Parking Space Detector** using computer vision techniques to identify available parking spots in real-time. It leverages OpenCV to process video feeds, detect parking regions, and determine their occupancy.

## üåü Features

* **Interactive Parking Space Selection:** `parking_space_picker.py` allows users to manually select and save the coordinates of parking spots on an image by clicking.
* **Real-time Occupancy Detection:** `main_parking_detector.py` processes a video feed to continuously check the occupancy of defined parking spaces.
* **Visual Feedback:** Displays bounding boxes around parking spaces with different colors indicating occupancy (e.g., green for free, red for occupied).
* **Free Space Counter:** Shows the number of available parking spaces.
* **Dynamic Reset:** The video feed automatically loops back to the beginning when it reaches the end.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies and Installation

This project is built primarily with **Python**. Here are the required libraries and how to install them:

* **Python 3.x**
* **OpenCV (`opencv-python`)**: For image and video processing.
* **`cvzone`**: A powerful computer vision library that simplifies many OpenCV tasks.
* **NumPy**: For numerical operations, especially with image arrays.

You can install all the necessary Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python cvzone numpy
